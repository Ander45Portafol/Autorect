                <p> Our store focuses on providing our customers with the best quality in terms of spare parts,
                    however there are certain regulations that help us carry out certain actions or situations
                    that may arise throughout the process of purchasing or delivering the products.</p>
                <p>The regulations encompass all those involved when buying through our platform, from customers
                    and users to sales advisors and external distributors.</p>
                <p>In order to make these processes and regulations known, we define a series of rules or
                    conditions to use our platform and make your necessary purchases safely and effectively.</p>
                <p class="modal-bold">Â· To our clients:</p>
                <p>a. We ask all our clients to ensure that before making their purchases through our platform,
                    they provide all the necessary data for stable and accessible communication between
                    themselves and the associated distributors.</p>
                <p>b. We ask our customers to be punctual and be present or leave someone in charge with their
                    confirmation data when receiving their products to avoid confusion and to verify the state
                    in which the purchase has been delivered.</p>
                <p>c. All our products have an extended warranty for a period of three business days for the
                    change of part.</p>
                <p>d. In order to make the exchange of the part effective, the client must present photographs
                    of the moment in which he receives his product, and the issued invoice.</p>
                <p>e. Having defined the previous clause, we intend to make it clear that Autorect does NOT
